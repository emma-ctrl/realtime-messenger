# ðŸš€ Fullstack Coding Task

**Tags:** -  
**Created by:** Jake

Develop a basic messaging app similar to facebook messenger or whatsapp.

## Required features

1. **Login page:**
   a. Users can log in with a username and a password

2. **Messaging page:**
   a. List of open threads, an option to create a new thread and a chat-view of the current thread
   b. Users can start new threads with each other using their username (DMs)
   c. Within each thread, messages are shown in chronological order with the latest message at the bottom
   d. New messages should appear in the threads automatically in real-time (i.e. user does not have to refresh page to receive new messages)

3. A readme with instructions for how to run it

## Tech stack

1. **Frontend:** React with Typescript and Tailwind
2. **Backend:**
   a. Either Nodejs or Python
   b. The API between backend and frontend should be type-safe (e.g. gRPC or tRPC, graphql)
3. **Database:** RDBMS like Postgres (preferred), MySQL etc.

## Notes

1. You should not create an admin page, registration page, forgot password page etc. Just hard code some users or add a seeding script
2. While it's great if the app looks good, the focus of this case is code, not design. Don't spend time making it pretty
3. You can use any libraries and dependencies you like

## Delivery

1. Create a github repository and give `Jacse`, `Jakob-em`, `kaifatdet`, `sundeqvist` and `ZinoKader` access
2. An oral presentation/discussion of the above, including motivations for technology picks and design choices. The discussion may broaden to more general technical questions.

Expected time spent on the task is **~4 hours +/- an hour**. If you get to 5-6 hours, please stop with the progress you made and we can discuss what you would've done if you had more time. **Do not spend more than 6 hours on this.**

You can use LLMs to generate code, but please make sure you understand all code and **you are proud of it**. We care a lot about maintainability of code and if you hand in poorly written LLM generated code we will reject you.

**Good luck!**
